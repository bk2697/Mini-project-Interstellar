### Design Summary
* Strategy
    * In terms of users needs, users will have access to a STEM story that will provide them with education and fun activities to engage with. Additionally, users will *hopefully* be empowered to tackle STEM inside and outside of school settings. With owners needs, we wanted to make the story personable. To make it personable, we made sure the title would insert the name as the protagonist. Then, we wanted to engage them with interactive activities to demonstrate that girls rock in the STEM field. We hoped to capture the interest of girls (of elementary school age - 4th to 5th graders) so that they will not only read the story book, but also showcase that STEM is *cool* and that they use it in everyday context.

* Scope
    * The objective of this site is to change attitudes of young girls about STEM. Since most kids learn through reading books and playing games, we aimed to empower girls by showing them that girl characters in books can be, and are, just like them - rock stars in STEM, in and out of classrooms. In order to achieve these objectives, it includes three components. First, immersing girls in interactive STEM projects. Second, allowing girls to design and create anything they want using tools from the digital story book. Third, encouraging problem solving and confidence in relation to the stereotypes of girls in STEM. We want to expand ways to reach young girls to think about STEM as potential fields to pursue.
    * Specific functionality that we need
        * name comment box with button - to make a personalized character
            * example: Interstellar MARIAella
        * book activity - choosing which books are needed to repair the ship using click and popups
            * if user chooses the correct books, there would be great feedback
            * if user chooses the wrong books, there will be *motivational* messages allowing them to try again until they get it correct
    * Specific content that we need
        * Story book text that has:
            * a narrative
            * a mission/ a problem
            * activities to solve it
         * positive messages just in case user does not accomplish activities the first time
